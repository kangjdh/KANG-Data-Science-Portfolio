Before we meet the penguins... let's figure out how to get to them first! :ice_cube:

### :parrot: Prep kit! :parrot:
- An environment that can read .py files and run streamlit (ex. Visual Studio Code <image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg/2048px-Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg.png" alt="image" width="21"/> )
- and... that's it!

### :ringed_planet: Running the App :ringed_planet:
1. After going into the [basic_streamlit_app folder](https://github.com/kangjdh/KANG-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app) in this [repository](https://github.com/kangjdh/KANG-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main), download the project's script, *main.py*, and the dataset in the data folder, *penguin.csv*, onto your device by clicking the download icon near the top right corner of the screen <image src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/019/879/209/non_2x/download-button-on-transparent-background-free-png.png" alt="image" width="21"/>
2. Open File Explorer (Windows) <image src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/windows/images/0/04/File_Explorer_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20240208004644" alt="image" width="21"/> or Finder (Mac) <image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Finder_Icon_macOS_Big_Sur.png" alt="image" width="21"/>
3. Locate both files (the script and .csv file) and place them into a new folder named appropriately together (ex. BasicStreamlitApp)
4. Open the folder onto your environment
5. Open the terminal and enter `cd {folder name}` to ensure you are in the right folder
7. Type `streamlit run main.py` into the terminal and press enter
8. A website for the app should pop up on your browser, and you are now ready to go! :tada:
