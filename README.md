## KANG-Data-Science-Portfolio

This repository is a collection of all my works accomplished as a student taking <em>Introduction to Data Science</em> in the Spring of 2025 at the University of Notre Dame.

### Projects

- <em>(each project will include a small picture/diagram that represents the project's theme on either the right or left of the screen</em>

- On the side that does not include the image/diagram, there will be text explaining the project
    - <em>example:</em>  
      **Question:** The question that sparked interest in the project or the question that was aimed to be answered in no more than two sentences

      **Project:** A short paragraph describing exactly what was measured and calculated to answer exactly what question in detail, as well as a brief explanation of how the information necessary was collected and analyzed. The goal is to be detailed but concise so that viewers are compelled to click on an included link to read further about the details of the project and the conclusion.

      **Techincal skills:** A list of technical skills (languages, data visualization programs, etc) utilized during the project  
- Each project will be followed by a horizontal line as below to separate the information with clarity
