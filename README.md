## KANG-Data-Science-Portfolio

This repository is a collection of all my works accomplished as a student taking <em>Introduction to Data Science</em> in the Spring of 2025 at the University of Notre Dame.

### Projects
**Data Science Portfolio - (2024)** üå∑  
This portfolio is a collection of my earliest data science works completed during my time as a student enrolled in the course <em>Introduction to Data Science</em> as an undergraduate student at <em>the University of Notre Dame</em>.

**Tidy Data Project - (2025)** üåª 

‚ùì _Question_: How do we organize and/or prepare data?

> This repository includes my first steps into learning and understanding data wrangling and ***data tidying*** as a vital part of data science. The project contained within focuses on reorganizing the data on R&D spending by government departments into an organized, readable structure along with basic pivot tables created using the tidy data aimed to exemplify the purpose of tidying data. This project too is an extension of my journey into exploring data science as a student studying the subject at the <em> University of Notre Dame.</em> <br>

**Supervised Machine Learning Application - (2025)** üåπ

‚ùì _Question_: How can we use supervised machine learning to make sense of data?

> This folder contains my first streamlit app that aims to allow users to input datasets and experiment with different ___supervised machine learning___ models, their hyperparameters if applicable, and the effect on the results and model quality. This project grows my understanding on machine learning by teaching me how each model, linear regression, logistic regression, and decision tree, uses the features and dataset given to derive its prediction. This still further enhanced my data science skills by allowing me to make user interactive apps, expanding my ability to work with various datasets and even other people. \

**Unsupervised Machine Learning Application - (2025)** :blossom:

‚ùì _Question_: How can we use unsupervised machine learning technique to make sense of data?

> An extension of the streamlit journey above, this app focuses instead on creating a platform for users to try different __unsupervised machine learning__ techniques, along with experimenting with different hyperparameters and reviewing performance feedback metrics. Through this project, I expanded my knowledge of machine learning by understanding different methods for handling unlabeled data, namely PCA, Kmeans Clustering, and Hierarhcial Clustering, to reduce dimensionality and cluster data points based on similarity. Additionally, I was able to experiment with different streamlit functions to make a user-friendlym aesthetic UI, enhancing important passive skills for data scientists. \
