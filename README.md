**Tidy Data Project - (2025)** ðŸŒ»  
This repository includes my first steps into learning and understanding data wrangling and **data tidying** as a vital part of data science. The project contained within focuses on reorganizing the data on R&D spending by government departments into an organized, readable structure along with basic pivot tables created using the tidy data aimed to exemplify the purpose of tidying data. This project too is an extension of my journey into exploring data science as a student studying the subject at the <em> University of Notre Dame.</em> <br>
